The content keyword takes the styles from our rules and puts them wherever finds the @content keyword. With an example it's easier to understand:

So, if we declare this mixin: 

@mixin mQ($arg...) {
  @media screen and (max-width: $arg)){
    @content;
  }
}

And call the mixin in whatever rule like this:

li {
    float: left;
    width: (100% / 6);
    @include mQ(600px) {
      width: 100%;
    }
}

It will put what is inside mQ(600px) on the @content "line", so you can have the same condition with different sentences inside.
